Although Python is only one of many such programming languages, it's very similar to a lot of others, so whatever you learn in Python can easily be transferred to other languages. Other popular programming languages include Java, C, and JavaScript.\n",

    "Additionally, we should introduce <b>comments,</b> which you may have noticed above. Anything after a hashtag (**#**) in a line of Python code isn't actually run; it's just there as a note by the programmer. These are really useful to document what code does in-line with the code itself, and using them is considered *really* good coding practice."
